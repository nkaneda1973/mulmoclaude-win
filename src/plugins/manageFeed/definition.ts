    "Manage the user's data-source FEEDS — recurring retrievals of internet data (RSS/Atom news, podcasts, or any JSON API that returns an ARRAY of objects) that land in a self-refreshing collection. A feed is registered ONCE as data (stored under <workspace>/feeds/, NOT as a skill, so it does not bloat the prompt) and the host re-fetches it on a schedule. Records render in the standard collection view at /collections/<slug>. " +
    "After every action the response carries the current feed list so the canvas can re-render; call action='list' to display it.\n\n" +
    "REGISTER takes `slug` + a `schema` that is a CollectionSchema PLUS an `ingest` block. The schema shape is STRICT — follow it exactly:\n" +
    "- `primaryKey` (string, required): the name of the id field.\n" +
    "- `fields` (object, required): a MAP keyed by field name — NOT an array. Each value is `{ type, label, primary? }`. Exactly one field sets `primary: true` and its key must equal `primaryKey`.\n" +
    "- `type` MUST be one of: string, text, email, number, date, boolean, markdown, enum. (There is no 'url'/'datetime'/'textarea' — use string for links, date for timestamps, text/markdown for bodies.)\n" +
    "- `title` (string, required): human-facing name. `icon` and `dataPath` are OPTIONAL — omit them and the host defaults icon to a feed glyph and dataPath to `data/feeds/<slug>`.\n" +
    "- `displayField` (recommended): the field whose value labels each record in the calendar view and notifications — set it to the human-readable field (e.g. the title). Without it, labels fall back to the primaryKey, which for a feed is an opaque id.\n" +
    "- `ingest`: { kind, url, schedule, map, itemsAt?, idFrom? }. kind = 'rss'|'atom' (XML) or 'http-json' (JSON array). schedule = 'hourly'|'daily'|'weekly'|'on-demand'.\n" +
    "- `map`: { <yourFieldName>: <sourcePath> }, where sourcePath is a dot/bracket path into each fetched ITEM. The host hard-codes NO field list for any feed — first INSPECT the actual feed/response and map the fields it really carries, choosing whatever is useful. For rss/atom each item is the parsed XML element: tags are keys (e.g. 'title', 'link', 'pubDate'), attributes are keyed `@_name` (e.g. 'enclosure.@_url'), and namespaced tags keep their prefix (e.g. 'dc:creator', 'itunes:duration'); text-bearing tags resolve to their text automatically. For http-json each item is the JSON object (e.g. 'name', 'data.id'). A value mapped into a field you declared `type: 'date'` is auto-parsed to an ISO timestamp, so point date fields at the feed's date/timestamp path.\n" +
    "- `itemsAt` (http-json only): dot/bracket path to the items array, e.g. 'results[]' (omit when the response itself is the array).\n" +
    "- `idFrom` (optional): a sourcePath giving a stable unique id (e.g. an item guid/id/link) used for the record id when the mapped primaryKey is empty, so re-fetches upsert in place instead of duplicating.\n" +
    "- `maxItems` (optional, default 100): cap on stored records — after each fetch the feed keeps only the newest `maxItems` by its `date` field and deletes the rest (set 0 to keep everything). Include a `date` field in the schema so pruning has an ordering; without one, pruning is skipped.\n\n" +
